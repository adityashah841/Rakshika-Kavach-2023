# Rakshika - New Age Women Safety Application🛡️

### Kavach 2023 - Rakshika is a revolutionary women's safety application developed as part of Kavach 2023, a prestigious national-level hackathon organized by the Ministry of Education's Innovation Cell (AICTE). In collaboration with the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) and the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), Rakshika aims to tackle the security challenges of the 21st century faced by Indian intelligence agencies. This project harnesses cutting-edge technology including artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, automation, big data, and cloud computing.

## Problem Statement : 

<p>Design and develop a Women safety app that automatically senses the danger to a mobile user and triggers an SOS alert with location details based on multimodal data from a mobile device such as audio, video, image, motion detection etc., given a situation that the user is not able to operate the mobile.</p>


## Key Features of Rakshika:
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration via Aadhar Number, Phone Number, and OTP.
* Emergency SOS: Instantly triggers video recording and evidence capture while sending live location signals to emergency contacts, rakshika warriors in that region and police patrol vans.

* Proximity Notifications: Alerts when nearby emergency contacts or warriors are on their way
* Educational Blogs: Empowers users with self-defense and safety awareness.
* Admin Insights: Provides crime prevention statistics, reports, and visual dashboards.
* Trusted Network: Establishes a web of emergency contacts for trusted assistance.
* Multilingual Support: Available in both Hindi and English.
* IoT Device Integration: Special IoT device for remote areas without internet.
* Self-Defense Mechanism: IoT device capable of delivering a non-lethal electric shock.
